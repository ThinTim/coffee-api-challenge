### The Challenge
Create an API that passes the PACTO contract tests in this repository.

### To Win
#### We will be looking for:
- Clean code
- Evidence of TDD
- A go script
- A readme

#### With extra credit for:
- A CD pipeline (e.g. SnapCI)
- A deployed API (e.g. Heroku)
- Submitting a solution as a pair

### To Submit
Feel free to paste a link to your solution github repo into the code challenge email thread or email one of the Software Shokunin Community organisers directly with a link.  

If you donâ€™t want to post code publicly we still encourage you to give the challenge a go!  Use the problem to exercise your skills, take your brain for a jog and work those typing muscles!!


Peace and love fellow Shokunin
